# Hey there 👋 I'm Stelios — a CS Student with a passion for cloud, software engineering and security

## About Me
- Studying Computer Engineering & Informatics @ University of West Attica
- Building personal projects in my free time
- Passionate about bridging theory and real-world applications

## Projects
- [AWS-Cloud-Projects](https://github.com/SteliosSpanos/cloud-engineering-AWS): A repo that shows my journey and improvement in cloud technologies. It includes every AWS project that i did along with full documentation for each. (AWS)
- [Mini Content-Addressable-Storage](https://github.com/SteliosSpanos/mini-CAS): A content-addressable storage (CAS) system inspired by CVMFS. Mini-CAS stores files by their SHA-256 hash rather than their original path, enabling automatic deduplication, efficient storage management and verification with merkle trees. (Golang / Docker / SQLite)
- [D-State-Debugger](https://github.com/SteliosSpanos/dstate-debugger): Linux debugging tool that detects and diagnoses processes stuck in D-state (uninterruptible sleep). Scans /proc to identify blocked processes, reads kernel stack traces, maps syscalls to names, and reports what they're blocked on. (C)
- [Pocket-Git](https://github.com/SteliosSpanos/pocket-git): Git-like version control system implementation built in C++03 as a preperation for contrinuting to CVMFS, demonstrating the core concepts and internal architecture of Git. (C++)
- [Flashcard-Assistant](https://github.com/SteliosSpanos/flashcard-assistant): CRUD API based flashcard assistant that generates personalized study content, tracks your learning streaks, and sends daily study challenges to Discord to keep you on track. (Python-FastAPI / Postgresql / Docker)
